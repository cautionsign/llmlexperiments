What happens when we die,
In that eternal slumber's sigh?
Do we journey to realms unknown,
Or find solace in peace, our own?

In this realm of endless night,
Where stars may flicker and ignite,
The answers hide, deep and profound,
As we traverse to the unknown ground.

Is it an eternal dream we keep,
Or the secret only the departed reap?
A canvas of life, every soul's unique art,
A whisper in the wind, a story from the heart.

When the final breath takes its flight,
Do we find the day or eternal night?
A riddle in the cosmos, a tale untold,
As we navigate toward a future, bold.

In the end, the answer's shrouded in grace,
A journey for each to embrace,
For when we pass to the great unknown,
A new adventure is beautifully sewn.
