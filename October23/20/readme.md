Ok I'm going to bed early. 
I was going to try and get blender code generation running on my ubuntu machine but like I said I was tired. 

So Instead I generated a program that generated ascii art - it lacks detail -but hey a computer made it. 

first I said
"generate a color saturated pictoral landscape with ascii based on the hudson river valley"
and this came out

It sort of looks like moby dick.  And maybe I should do ascii art based on moby dick or something incomprehensible  like Finnegan's Wake, but I went with plants because I am an herbalist. 

### Prompt
>create a python program that generates multi color ascii art of different plants when you enter the name of the plant

This generated a program that generated multicolor ascii art for a rose and a palm tree. It was excited. I wonder why those two plants  so I asked the LLM

>why did you choose rose and palm tree

> I chose "rose" and "palm tree" as examples in the initial response because they are common and easily recognizable plants with distinct shapes. These choices allowed me to provide a simple and understandable example of how to create ASCII art representations of plants. Additionally, one of the plants was a flowering plant (rose), and the other was a tree (palm tree), showcasing some diversity in plant types.

> However, ASCII art can represent a wide variety of subjects, and you can create ASCII art for practically anything. If you have specific plants or other subjects you'd like to see as ASCII art or if you have any other requests or questions, please feel free to let me know, and I'll be happy to assist you further.

So I next asked ChatGPT to generate 30 more plants and it did. 

### Code
Here is the code for the first prompt. The final code is in the repo in github. 
Creating a Python program that generates multi-color ASCII art for different plants based on the input (plant name) is a complex task. You'd need to define ASCII art patterns for each plant, specify their colors, and handle user input. This example demonstrates a simplified version that you can build upon:

For this example, we'll create ASCII art for two plants: a rose and a palm tree. You can expand the program to include more plants and enhance the ASCII art for each.

```python
# Import the colorama library for colored text in the console
from colorama import Fore, Style, init

# Initialize colorama
init(autoreset=True)

# Define ASCII art for different plants
plant_art = {
    "rose": f"{Fore.RED} @@@{Fore.RESET}\n{Fore.RED} @@@{Fore.RESET}\n{Fore.RED} @@@{Fore.RESET}\n{Fore.RED} @@@{Fore.RESET}\n{Fore.GREEN}  |  {Fore.RESET}\n{Fore.GREEN} / \\ {Fore.RESET}",
    "palm tree": f"{Fore.GREEN}    ^ {Fore.RESET}\n{Fore.GREEN}   ^^^{Fore.RESET}\n{Fore.GREEN}  ^^^^{Fore.RESET}\n{Fore.GREEN} ^^^^^{Fore.RESET}\n{Fore.YELLOW} ^^^^^{Fore.RESET}",
}

# Main function to generate plant ASCII art
def generate_plant_art(plant_name):
    plant_name = plant_name.lower()
    if plant_name in plant_art:
        print(plant_art[plant_name])
    else:
        print(f"Sorry, I don't have ASCII art for {plant_name}.")

# Get user input and generate plant ASCII art
if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_input = input("Enter the name of a plant: ")
    generate_plant_art(user_input)
```

In this program:

1. We define ASCII art patterns for the "rose" and "palm tree" and store them in the `plant_art` dictionary. We use color codes from the `colorama` library to add color to the art.

2. The `generate_plant_art` function takes the user's input (plant name), converts it to lowercase, and checks if it exists in the `plant_art` dictionary. If it does, it prints the corresponding ASCII art; otherwise, it provides an error message.

3. The main part of the program gets user input and calls the `generate_plant_art` function with the input.

Please note that this is a simplified example. You can expand the `plant_art` dictionary with more plants and enhance the ASCII art to create a more extensive and colorful collection of plant representations.

### Conclusion
I then wanted something animated. and I asked
>can you animate the ascii

and chat generated a python program of a butterfly. I meant to generate like a growing plant but I love butterflies. 
>  
why did you pick a butterfly


I asked...
>I chose to use a "butterfly" as an example for the animated ASCII art because butterflies are visually appealing and their fluttering motion is well-suited for creating a simple and recognizable animation effect. Butterflies have distinctive shapes, which makes them a good choice for ASCII art representation, and the animation adds an engaging element to the example.

I asked to regenerate this response many times but it never changed. 

This is my first time using colorama library.  It was lots of fun I love color and I love plants.
