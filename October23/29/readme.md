# Experiment 17 — Failed chat gpt integration — the queer art of failure

For this I attempted to integrate chat gpt (via open ai) and rasa. I tried to do most of my debugging via chatgpt. But it failed. I may revisit it.

The first failure was a malformed action file in rasa

the second failure was a missing endpoint in rasa

the third failure was missing policy definitions in rasa

The key is to do some debugging and then ask chat how to fix the specific error you have found.

WHOMP

here is the code
