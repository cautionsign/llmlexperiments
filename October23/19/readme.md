###3D
So I was trying to get the llm blender code integration to work but I
think there is a bug with osx. I am going to try wiht my ubuntu machine
tomorrow. 

Instead I have been thinking about GIS and geographical data. 

###Prompt
>i create a simulation of a volcano from us geological data


####Code
Creating a realistic simulation of a volcano using US Geological data is a complex and data-intensive task that typically involves geographic information systems (GIS), computational fluid dynamics, and geological data sources. However, I can provide a simplified Python example of how to create a basic visual representation of a volcano using 3D graphics with the VPython library. This simulation is not based on real geological data but can serve as a starting point for visualization:

```python
from vpython import *

# Create the 3D scene
scene = canvas(title="Volcano Simulation", width=800, height=600)

# Create a simple volcano cone
volcano_cone = cone(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), axis=vector(0, 1, 0), radius=5, color=color.red)

# Create a lava flow
lava = cylinder(pos=vector(0, 0, 0), axis=vector(0, 5, 0), radius=0, color=color.orange)

# Create a ground plane
ground = box(pos=vector(0, -5, 0), length=20, height=0.1, width=20, color=color.green)

# Simulation loop
t = 0
dt = 0.01
while True:
    rate(100)  # Adjust the frame rate as needed

    # Make the lava flow down
    lava.pos.y -= 0.1
    t += dt

    # Restart lava flow when it reaches the ground
    if lava.pos.y < ground.pos.y:
        lava.pos.y = 0
        t = 0
```

In this code, we use the VPython library to create a basic 3D scene with a volcano cone and lava flow. The lava flows down and restarts when it reaches the ground. Keep in mind that this is a simplified visual representation for educational purposes and is not based on real geological data.

Creating a scientifically accurate volcano simulation would require access to geological data, including terrain data, eruption dynamics, and possibly a GIS platform for visualizing the data. This goes far beyond the scope of a simple Python script and would typically involve collaboration with experts in the field of geology and volcanology.

### Conclusion 
I did not use my template from yesterday. I regret that. However I was
fascinated that LLM created a website to view 3D data. I never used
vpython before.
