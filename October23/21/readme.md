### Experiment 9 - Audio Generation 

Today was a bit of a gpt fail. I decided I was going to install the blender python library on my linux machine and do that - but as of now the install is still failing! In the meantime I returned to my csound puttering which I will not officially give up on sinceI have not been able to generate anything that works in a week. I'll move on to tidal cycles. What I did was generate the sound of the lifecycle of milkweed. 

### What did I do
Roughly I asked gpt to generate a csound file that represents the lifecycle of milkweed and when the csound file did not work I asked it to use a different programming language.  It picked python and the result is in [Experiment 9 in my github repo](https://github.com/msrobot0/llmlexperiments/).

The Result is also in that file because I am too lazy to upload it to soundcloud. 

### Reflections
I also attempted to generate a visualization of this that looked like an oscilliscope. None of my efforts worked. And then I asked GPT to just generate a video - this also did not work. Sometimes experiments fail.  

I do feel super burnt out. But I am pushing through on the daily experiments. I believe there is something on the other side of this!
