# Experiment 18 — Twine Video Game

No one really interacted with my write up for the last experiment — the queer art of failure — my inability to get my rasa bot to integrate with openai.

So be it!

Today I finally generated a twine game. Actually I generated two twine games and it was AMAZING.

First off I have not used twine since 2015. I became obsessed with twine when I read the book the [Rise of the Video Game Zinesters](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/215174/rise-of-the-videogame-zinesters-by-anna-anthropy/) that I bought at [Bluestockings](https://bluestockings.com/) before going to one of the amazing yoga classes at what is now Fierce Grace on Allen Street.

The book is amazing — I feel like I might have once pitched a twine project on the work of octavia butler or the octavia butler archive.

I said

> create a twine game about the methylation of tryptophan

Then I said — make. this more colorful with choices and SVG generated graphics (none of the buttons work).

>Creating a twine game about the methylation of tryptophan can be a unique and educational way to explore the topic. Below is an outline for such a game:

**Title:** Methylation of Tryptophan: A Molecular Adventure

**Introduction:**  
You are about to embark on a molecular adventure where you’ll explore the methylation of tryptophan, a vital process in the body. As a curious scientist, you’ve been miniaturized and injected into the body to witness this process firsthand.

**Scene 1: The Microscopic World**  
*You find yourself inside the bloodstream, surrounded by red and white blood cells. Your journey begins as you navigate the microscopic world.*

- **Choice 1:** Explore the bloodstream.  
- **Choice 2:** Follow the chemical signals.

**Scene 2: Tryptophan Encounter**  
*You follow the chemical signals and arrive at the site where tryptophan molecules are located. They’re about to undergo methylation.*

- **Choice 1:** Observe the tryptophan molecules.  
- **Choice 2:** Interact with an enzyme involved in methylation.

**Scene 3: Methylation Process**  
*You’ve chosen to observe the tryptophan molecules. They’re about to undergo the methylation process.*

- **Choice 1:** Watch the methylation process.  
- **Choice 2:** Learn more about the importance of methylation.

**Scene 4: Interaction with an Enzyme**  
*You’ve chosen to interact with an enzyme involved in the methylation process. This enzyme will explain its role.*

- **Choice 1:** Listen to the enzyme’s explanation.  
- **Choice 2:** Ask the enzyme questions.

**Scene 5: The Importance of Methylation**  
*You’ve chosen to learn more about the importance of methylation. Discover the significance of this process in the body.*

- **Choice 1:** Learn about the biological functions.  
- **Choice 2:** Understand the role in gene regulation.

**Scene 6: The Outcome**  
*You’ve completed your journey, and now it’s time to reflect on your adventure.*

- **Choice 1:** Return to the macroscopic world.  
- **Choice 2:** Review what you’ve learned.

**Conclusion:**  
You’ve successfully completed your adventure through the methylation of tryptophan. This vital process plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and maintaining various biological functions. Your newfound knowledge may have a positive impact on your future scientific endeavors.

This twine game provides an interactive and educational experience for players interested in learning about the methylation of tryptophan in a fun and engaging way. You can add more details, images, and explanations to make the experience even more immersive.

# Twine is amazing

I am wondering if the pressure of doing an llm experiment everyday is taxing my thyroid

I feel like the road is changing -I would say that I feel like I am getting there — but I am already here — where is there -this is it — i am that.
