# Let There Be Light 
I feel like I am going in a dada direction here - or a surrealist or something -  something elliptical and nonsensical but meaningul


The thing about making art with your computer is that you really have to know what you are doing before hand. You must have a vision and then the determination to execute that vision. Execiting an artistic vision with code is hard, because in the case of painting or drawing, if you dont execute your vision you will still have a painting or a drawing, but if in the case of code if you dont execute your vision or execute it poorl you may not even have something that runs - that creates anything. This is similar to architecture - if I cant execute my vision or execute it poorly in architecture then maybe I have a house that falls down, or is leaky (I am thinking of frank lloyd wright)
